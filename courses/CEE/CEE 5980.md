## Student Feedback

### Fall 2021

> One of the things I most appreciated about this class was its organization. I really liked that from day one, there were clear due dates and modules for the rest of the semester, which helped me plan my work a lot easier. Additionally, it was really nice to get exposure to the relevant researchers and fundamental papers in the field. I also really appreciated the clarity of the pre-recorded videos he had us watch, and I feel like he did a great job of making sure that the information that was taught in the videos was reflected in the assignments and quizzes. One of the main points of the class is to expose you to different methods of tackling different types of problems and to make sure to think critically about which methods to use in which contexts, and I think he did a great job really making us think about those ideas.

> I would recommend this course to any new student. This course will help you fill in a lot of gaps in background that may help with your own research in this group. There were a lot of times throughout the semester that we learned a new concept or vocab word in this class that ended up coming up in my conversations. Overall, I recommend this course to help expose you to some fundamental concepts, authors, and ideas that will likely improve your background with your research.
